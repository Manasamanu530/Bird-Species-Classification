This project aims to automatically identify bird species from images using deep learning. 
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on the "CUB-200-2011" dataset, which contains over 11,000 images across 200 bird species.
The model learns to extract features from bird images and classify them into the correct species. 
This system can help bird watchers, researchers, and nature enthusiasts quickly recognize birds through image uploads. 
The project is implemented using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and deployed with a Flask web application.
